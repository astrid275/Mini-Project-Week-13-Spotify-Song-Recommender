# Mini Project Week 13 Spotify Song Recommender
Scenario: I have been hired as a Data Analyst for Gnoosic. The goal is to redefine how users discover music, not just based on their listening history but by allowing them to explore songs based on sound, mood, and energy. The outcome is to design a new music recommendation system that gives users two powerful ways to find songs: 1. By selecting a type of music they want to listen to (e.g. Rock, High Energy, Calm). 2. By asking for a currently trending song, no matter the genre. This interactive music recommender will be tested live and assessed.
